In the fall of my sophomore year, I joined the Website team for [HopHacks](https://hophacks.com/), JHU's annual hackathon.

This was my first extended web development project. When I joined the team, our stack was comprised of a React frontend, a MongoDB database, and [MeteorJS](https://www.meteor.com/) tying everything together. Meteor turned out to cause us more problems down the line, so in 2020-2021 the backend was rewritten in Flask.


In 2020, we transitioned to hosting a fully virtual hackathon conducted through Discord and Zoom. One of the cool things I picked up during this time is learning to code bots for Discord, which we used to automate our check-in process.
