Wikipedia Speedrunning is an activity where you try to get from one Wikipedia page to another using only the links on the Wikipedia pages. My friends from college and I are building a site that allows people to compete against one another. We currently have a ranking system to support a leaderboard, and we are building out different gamemodes as well.

You can try our game [here](https://wikispeedruns.com/)!
